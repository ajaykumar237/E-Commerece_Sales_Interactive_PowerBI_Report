### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

2. Leveraged Power Query Editor, DAX for Extract, Tranform, Load (ETL) process
   - Data Transform - made first row as headers in two sheets (Returns, People)
   - Data Extraction - added three new columns (Delivery Days, Year, Return 1)
  
     - Delivery Days = ([Ship date - Order date]) ---> using custom column
     - Year = Date.Year([order date]) ---> using custom column
     -  Return 1 = If returns equals to Yes then 1 ---> using conditional colum
       
   


### Data Analysis

2. Created Bar charts to find out the top 5 profit and loss making products
3. Used year slicer to filter the data based on year selection (2012,2013,2014,2015)
4. To visually analyze the sales as per country at a quick glance incorporated world map

### Results/ Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Maximum sale segment is consumer (~51.48%) followed by corporate (~30%) and home office (~18%)
- Asia Pacific (~32%), Europe (~26%), USCA (~19%) are the top 3 buying continents
- Total sales amount generated by Amazon is $12.64 miilion
